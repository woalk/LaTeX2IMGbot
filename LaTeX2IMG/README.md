# LaTeX2IMG
A small program for converting LaTeX code into an image, using [codecogs](http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php).

## Usage
```
./LaTeX2IMG <equation> <output name> <output extension>
```

## Credit
This was written by [analca3](https://github.com/analca3) and published first at GitHub in [his standalone repo](https://github.com/analca3/LaTeX2IMG).
Rather than a fork, this small repo was added to the project as a whole, and will be developed dependently by me.
